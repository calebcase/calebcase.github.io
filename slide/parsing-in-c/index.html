# Parsing in C with Advanced GCC Tricks

class: center, middle

### We will commit many sins; may the CS gods forgive us.

## Gotos

You remember these right?

```c
int
main()
{
  goto a_label;

  printf(&#34;This won&#39;t be printed.\n&#34;);

a_label:
  printf(&#34;At our label!\n&#34;);

  return 0;
}
```

```terminal
$ ./a.out
At our label!
```

_&#34;infinitely abusable&#34;_ - Kernighan &amp; Ritchie

---

## Computed Gotos

Your typical label:

```c
a_label:
```

A pointer to anything:

```c
void *any_label;
```

Taking the address of a label:

```c
any_label = &amp;&amp;a_label;
```

Jumping to the label we are pointing at:

```c
goto *any_label;
```

```c
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;string.h&gt;

int
main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
  void *where;

  if (strcmp(argv[1], &#34;here&#34;) == 0) {
      where = &amp;&amp;l_here;
  } else if (strcmp(argv[1], &#34;there&#34;) == 0) {
      where = &amp;&amp;l_there;
  }

  goto *where;

l_done:
  return 0;

l_here:
  printf(&#34;Here: %p\n&#34;, &amp;&amp;l_here);
  goto l_done;

l_there:
  printf(&#34;There: %p\n&#34;, &amp;&amp;l_there);
  goto l_done;
}
```

```terminal
$ ./a.out here
Here: 0x560725c586fb
$ ./a.out there
There: 0x560ce1317715
```

## Designated Inits

This is standard C99:

```c
int a[6] = {
  [4] = 29,
  [2] = 15
};
```

GCC extends this with support for range initializers:

```c
int widths[] = {
  [0 ... 9] = 1,
  [10 ... 99] = 2,
  [100] = 3
};
```

https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Designated-Inits.html

---

```c
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int
main()
{
  int a[6] = {
    [4] = 29,
    [2] = 15
  };

  int widths[] = {
    [0 ... 9] = 1,
    [10 ... 99] = 2,
    [100] = 3
  };

  for (int i = 0; i &lt; 6; i&#43;&#43;) {
    printf(&#34;a[%i] = %i\n&#34;, i, a[i]);
  }

  printf(&#34;widths[8] = %i\n&#34;, widths[8]);
  printf(&#34;widths[77] = %i\n&#34;, widths[77]);
  printf(&#34;widths[100] = %i\n&#34;, widths[100]);
}
```

---

```terminal
$ ./a.out 
a[0] = 0
a[1] = 0
a[2] = 15
a[3] = 0
a[4] = 29
a[5] = 0
widths[8] = 1
widths[77] = 2
widths[100] = 3
```

### Surprises in the Standard Lib

```man
FGETC(3)                   Linux Programmer&#39;s Manual                  FGETC(3)

NAME
       fgetc, fgets, getc, getchar, ungetc - input of characters and strings

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

       int fgetc(FILE *stream);

       char *fgets(char *s, int size, FILE *stream);

       int getc(FILE *stream);

       int getchar(void);

       int ungetc(int c, FILE *stream);
```

Wait a second... what is this:

```c
       int ungetc(int c, FILE *stream);
```

---

```c
       int ungetc(int c, FILE *stream);
```

```man
DESCRIPTION
       ungetc() pushes c back to stream, cast to unsigned char, where it is
       available for subsequent read operations.  Pushed-back characters will
       be returned in reverse order; only one pushback is guaranteed.

RETURN VALUE
       ungetc() returns c on success, or EOF on error.
```

```c
       int fgetc(FILE *stream);
```

```man
DESCRIPTION
       fgetc() reads the next character from stream and returns it as an
       unsigned char cast to an int, or EOF on end of file or error.

RETURN VALUE
       fgetc(), getc() and getchar() return the character read as an unsigned
       char cast to an int or EOF on end of file or error.
```

So now we have functions we can use to get a single char from a stream... and
put it back if we don&#39;t want it!

---

We now have everything we need for very basic LL(1) parser!

* Use the designated inits as a way to map from a character to an action we
  want to take.
* Abuse those designated inits to also set a default action.
* Use the computed gotos to be the actions we want.
* Use more gotos to put the entire thing in a state machine loop.

## In the Wild

The tricks explained in these slides were used to create a JSON parser!

Let&#39;s take a closer look...
